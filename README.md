### Game rules

The main goal of the game is to compose a word from Letter-gems. To collect a gem Player should:

1.  Pick gem by moving to the same cell where it is located
2.  Deliver gem to the boat
3.  Swim away on a boat by staying aboard till the end of the game field

After Player has swum away, he returns to the starting position in the safe zone and he is able to continue hunting the gems.

Sometimes there appears additional ordinary gems. If Player collect them, he will receive additional points to the score. By the way: even if Player has swum away on a boat empty-handed he still receive additional points.

The difficult with this collecting process is that there are lots of enemy beetles. They interfere Player with crossing the game field. In addition every time Player collects a Letter-gem, the game speed increases and an additional beetle appears. If a beetle hits Player, then Player loses his life.

At the beginning Player has 3 lives. Player can increase lives amount by collecting Heart-gems. The lives limit is 5. If Player already has 5 lives and collect more Heart-gems, he will receive additional points to the score.

The game ends when all the letters are collected or Player has no more lives. You can see current progress (lives and letters) at the bottom of the game field.

After the game is over, Player will be asked to enter his name to the Leaderboard. You can see the the Leaderboard by pressing the "Show ratings" button at any time. Also, Player can restart the game by pressing the "Restart" button at any time.
